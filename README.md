# Aora, a simple React Native app which allow users to share their video generated by AI

## About

This project is built when I learn React Native to the YouTube channel JavaScript Mastery

Here is the video link : [React Native Course for Beginners in 2024 | Build a Full Stack React Native App](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCUegTZF7M&t=14382s&ab_channel=JavaScriptMastery)

And here is the Figma design : [Aora](https://www.figma.com/design/o6xKq25ETLqw5ebqgZonVp/Aora---React-Native-Crash-Course?node-id=3-310&p=f&t=yzX9YsXMU0udb14Z-0)

## Installation

- Download Expo Go on Google Play or PlayStore on your device phone
- Clone this project
- Open the cloned project with your favorite code editor
- Run `npm install` and then run `npx expo start -c` in the terminal
- Open the Expo Go app and scan the QR code in the terminal

**PS**: This project need SDK 52 or above to run

## Key changes

Since the video is released 10 month before I do this project, some packages are deprecated and I was trying to implement the new ones. You will find them along when you begin to follow the course.

## Todo

The bookmark feature will be implemented soon.
[UPDATE] I changed the bookmark name to saved name and the feature is implemented, just the UI of the modal to save the video looks ugly, I'll improve it. And remove video from the saved is also implemented.

## Notice

In the `/lib` folder, I've removed the `appwrite.js` file which contains the main function for all the apllication, but I've placed a file `appwrite-template.js` with blank Appwrite credantials for security.

**Happy Coding!** ðŸŽ‰
