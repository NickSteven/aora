# Aora, a simple React Native app which allow users to share their video generated by AI

## About

This project is built when I learn React Native to the YouTube channel JavaScript Mastery

Here is the video link : [React Native Course for Beginners in 2024 | Build a Full Stack React Native App](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBCUegTZF7M&t=14382s&ab_channel=JavaScriptMastery)

## Installation

- Download Expo Go on Google Play or PlayStore on your device phone
- Clone this project
- Open the cloned project with your favorite code editor
- Run `npm install` and then run `npx expo start -c` in the terminal
- Open the Expo Go app and scan the QR code in the terminal

**PS**: This project need SDK 52 or above to run

## Key changes

Since the video is released 10 month before I do this project, some packages are deprecated and I was trying to implement the new ones. You will find them along when you begin to follow the course.

## Todo

The bookmark feature will be implemented soon.

## Notice

In the `/lib` folder, I've removed the `appwrite.js` file which contains the main function for all the apllication, but I've placed a file `appwrite-template.js` with blank Appwrite credantials for security.

**Happy Coding!** ðŸŽ‰
